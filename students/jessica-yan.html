<h1>Jess Yan</h1>

<h2>Designer, Thing Maker</h2>

<p>Jess hails from Dirty South, Brooklyn. She exchanged her Coney Island for a Rhode Island and studied graphic design. Making all kinds of things is near to her being and after having spent some time making wooden glasses and tree-felling axes, she now finds herself Down Under the Manhattan Bridge with branding consultancy Red Antler. Had she been born in another time, she probably would have been a scribe.</p>

<p>Happily located in Bed Stuy, Do or Die.</p>
