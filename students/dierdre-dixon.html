		<p>I create interactive multimedia, primarily as a programmer, with some input into concept development, user interface and interaction design. My projects have included educational exhibits for museums and science centers, corporate installations, 3D games with physical interfaces, and games on the web. I've particularly enjoyed creating software that interfaces with custom hardware. Some example interfaces are: a bow and arrow, a DNA sculpture, fake ATM machine, and multi-touch projections.</p>
		
		<p>If I could, I'd spend every spare moment I have (when it's warm) kayaking or playing <a href="http://www.nykayakpolo.org/the_game.html" target="_blank">kayak polo</a>, or volunteering with the wonderful folk at the <a href="http://www.bbpboathouse.org/photos" target="_blank">Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse!</a></p>
