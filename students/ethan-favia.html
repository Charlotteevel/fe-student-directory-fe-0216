<p> I'm Ethan, for the past two years I've been working to get a music start up going. Experience and lack of funding have been the road blocks, but we're still pushing forward. So I've taken it apon myself to learn how to build it. I ran a clothing company out of my garage in high school, still work on new products from time to time. I love <span class="c"> c</span><span class="o">o</span><span class="l">l</span><span class="o2">o</span><span class="r">r</span><span class="s">s</span>, I often wear two different colors of the same style shoe, because its generally more interesting to look at. Fun fact, in one year I ate 36 pounds of gummy bears, or 1/4 of my body weight.  </p>
