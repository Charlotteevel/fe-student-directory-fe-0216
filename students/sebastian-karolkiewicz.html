		<h2 class="Heading">Biography</h2>
		<p class="Text">Sebastian graduated with a major in Biology and a minor in Fine Art. He attended the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in New York City. After three years, he realized medicine was not his calling. Since then he has pursued careers in art, education, and business. Throughout this period of self-exploration, he has found that he is a consummate entrepreneur and now finds himself at a rapidly growing tech company.</p>
