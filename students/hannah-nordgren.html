  <p>Hannah has had an eclectic background since she arrived in New York.  After graduating from Pratt with her BFA in fashion design she was a freelance technical designer, later a hairdresser and currently a developer. </p>

  <p>Hannah enjoys making beautiful applications and crafting solid code for interesting people doing interesting things.  When she's not tapping away at the keys, she's oftentimes found riding her single speed bike (year round!) around the city she loves.</p>
