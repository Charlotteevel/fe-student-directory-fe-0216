	<p>Hi, my name is Ian.  I'm originally from New Jersey, but please don't hold that against me!  I used to be a writer of words, but I've decided it is probably much more lucrative to learn to write code instead.  I love the New York Knicks, although it's getting harder and harder to keep rooting for them these days.  I will never forgive them for cutting my man, Metta World Peace, this past weekend only years after bringing him in and thus rectifying the mistake of drafting Fredric Weis instead of him back in the day....</p>
