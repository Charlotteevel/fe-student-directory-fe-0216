<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a 9-5 data analyst and a freelance photographer living in Brooklyn Heights. Most weekends, I can be found shooting photos or coaching a local running team, New York Harriers.  Well actually for the next several weekends I can be found watching front-end web dev videos. I got curious about coding last year; hope this class gets me started on a transition to web development.</p>
