      <p>Hi there. I'm Jasmine. I believe in the Helix fossil. Currently, I'm trying to fit in with my neighbors in Brooklyn and keep my head down in the Financial district when I'm working. I work for a software company that has a school-centric CMS where I provide tech support. Outside of that, you can find me looking for Jupiter in the sky, playing boardgames/RPGs, stenciling drinking whiskey for the taste, and perfecting the blanket burrito + Netflix combination.
