		<p>
			Luke Erikson's music was often poorly recorded and produced, given limited distribution, and was met with mostly negative reviews from critics.[3][4][5] Despite (or perhaps because of) these factors, Allin maintained a cult following throughout his career, and a fan base that has greatly expanded since his death.[citation needed] Though Allin promised for several years before his death that he would commit suicide onstage during one of his concerts, he died June 28, 1993 of an accidental heroin overdose.
