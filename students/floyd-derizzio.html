<h3 class = "Floyd">About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Floyd DeRizzio. I have an accounting background (MBA) in which I worked for IBM and Fidelity Investment. I started my own import/ export company which I operated for a couple of years. One of the projects that I started and love is my Tilapia farm which I raise fingerlings to an editable size. I am currently with the IRS but looking for new challenges. I am very excited about learning how to create websites. I look forward to learning more about the coding world.</p>
